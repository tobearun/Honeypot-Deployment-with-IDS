# Honeypot Deployment with Intrusion Detection System

This repository contains a project detailing the setup, implementation, and analysis of a honeypot with Suricata IDS on Kali Linux.

## Introduction

This report details the setup, implementation, and analysis of a honeypot project. The goal of the project is to deploy a honeypot that can attract, detect, and log malicious activities, providing insights into the types of attacks targeting the network.

## Setup and Configuration

### Tools and Technologies Used

The honeypot project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Suricata
- **Web Application for Exploitation:** Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)

### Steps to Set Up the Honeypot

To set up the honeypot environment, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Install Kali Linux:**
   - Download the Kali Linux ISO from the official website.
   - Install Kali Linux on a virtual machine or physical host.
   - Ensure the system is up-to-date.

2. **Deploy Suricata IDS:**
   - Install and configure Suricata to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activities.
   - Create and apply custom rules for enhanced detection.

3. **Set Up DVWA:**
   - Install Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) to simulate vulnerabilities.
   - Configure DVWA within the honeypot environment.

## Implementation

### Detailed Implementation Steps

This section outlines the step-by-step implementation of the honeypot environment with Suricata IDS and DVWA.

## Data Collection and Analysis

### Types of Attacks Detected

Various types of attacks were detected and logged by the honeypot, including:

- Port scans
- Brute-force attacks
- SQL injection attempts
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

### Data Analysis
