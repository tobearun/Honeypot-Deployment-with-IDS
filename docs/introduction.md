# Introduction

## Project Overview

This report details the setup, implementation, and analysis of a honeypot project integrated with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The objective is to deploy a honeypot that can attract, detect, and log malicious activities, providing insights into the types of attacks targeting the network.

### Goals

- Deploy a honeypot environment with Kali Linux, Suricata IDS, and Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA).
- Monitor and detect various types of attacks to gain insights into threat actors' techniques and behaviors.

### Methodology

The project includes setting up the honeypot environment, configuring the IDS, deploying the web application for exploitation, collecting data on attacks, analyzing the data, and summarizing the findings.

### Key Technologies

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Suricata
- **Web Application for Exploitation:** Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
